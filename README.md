## Case Studies

### Case study using Jupyter Notebook Markdown
This <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Sherbstreit/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/DSC550/DSC550_final.ipynb" target="_blank">case study assessing credit risk</a> shows methods which can improve loan default rates through identifying when a customer is high risk.

### Case study using Powerpoint
This <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Sherbstreit/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/29cb14758e4ba9ff8a7ba58ce8745354901a5eb1/DSC630/Customer_churn.pdf
" target="_blank">case study on reducing customer churn</a> builds a model from historical data to identify when a customer leaves a service. This model serves to signal a business to implement mitigation techniques to reduce its customer churn rates.
